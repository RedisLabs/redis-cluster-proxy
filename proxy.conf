# Redis Cluster Proxy configuration file example.
#
# Note that in order to read the configuration file, the proxy must be
# started with the file path passed to the -c option:
#
# ./redis-cluster-proxy -c /path/to/proxy.conf

################################## INCLUDES ###################################

# Include one or more other config files here.  Include files can include
# other files.
#
# If instead you are interested in using includes to override configuration
# options, it is better to use include as the last line.
#
# include /path/to/local.conf
# include /path/to/other.conf

######################## CLUSTER ENTRY POINT ADDRESS ##########################

# Indicate the entry point address in the same way it can be indicated in the
# redis-cluster-proxy command line arguments.
# Note that it can be overridden by the command line argument itself.
#
# cluster 127.0.0.1:7000

################################### MAIN ######################################

# Set the port used by Redis Cluster Proxy to listen to incoming connections
# from clients (default 7777)
port 7777

# If you want you can bind a single interface, if the bind option is not
# specified all the interfaces will listen for incoming connections.
# You can also bind on multiple interfaces by declaring bind on multiple lines
#
# bind 127.0.0.1

# Specify the path for the Unix socket that will be used to listen for
# incoming connections. There is no default, so Redis Cluster Proxy won't
# listen on a Unix socket when not specified.
#
# unixsocket /path/to/proxy.socket

# Set the Unix socket file permissions (default 0)
#
# unixsocketperm 760

# Set the number of threads.
threads 8

# Set the TCP keep-alive value on the Redis Cluster Proxy's socket
#
# tcpkeepalive 300

# Set the TCP backlog on the Redis Cluster Proxy's socket
#
# tcp-backlog 511

# Run Redis Cluster Proxy as a daemon.
daemonize no

# Enable cross-slot queries that can use multiple keys belonging to different
# slots or even different nodes.
# WARN: these queries will break the the atomicity deisgn of many Redis
# commands.
# NOTE: cross-slots queries are not supported by all the commands, even if
# this feature is enabled
#
# enable-cross-slot no

# Maximum number of clients allowed
#
# max-clients 10000

# Authentication password used to authenticate on the cluster in case its nodes
# are password-protected. The password will be used both for fetching cluster's
# configuration and to automatically authenticate proxy's internal connections
# to the cluster itself (both multiplexing shared connections and clients'
# private connections. So, clients connected to the proxy won't need to issue
# the Redis AUTH command in order to be authenticated.
#
# auth mypassw

# Authentication username (supported by Redis >= 6.0)
#
# auth-user myuser
